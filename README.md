# **Avionics Ground Station**

This repository is particularly reserved for the Avionics Ground Station team, if you wish to see the code for the Avionics in-rocket telemetry systems please visit the [Avionics](https://github.com/AstroJays-Hopkins) repository. 

## **Overview**

The ground station code invovles the making of a GUI made using REACT-JS as the front-end using flaskApp as the backend where most of the functionality and communication with the in-rocket telemetry systems occurs. 
Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, and Jinja 2. 
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. React efficiently updates and renders just the right components when your data changes.
